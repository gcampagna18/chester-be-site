                <p>Throughout his life, Bennington struggled with trauma from sexual abuse as a child as well was substance abuse and depression. To comfort himself, he drew pictures and wrote poetry and songs. Bennington took an interest in music at a young age, citing the bands Depeche Mode and Stone Temple Pilots as his earliest inspirations. He even dreamed of becoming a member of Stone Temple Pilots — something he actually achieved later in life. <br> <br> Bennington had six children in total. He had three children from previous relationships before 2005, and three children after his marriage to Talinda Bentley in 2006. </p>

                <p>Bennington was a close friend of Chris Cornell. The friendship between them originally started in the mid-2000s, but it  strengthened during the Projekt Revolution Tour when Bennington joined Cornell on stage to sing Hunger Strike, and then Cornell joined Bennington to sing Crawling.  When Cornell passed away in early 2017, Bennington commented on Cornell’s death, stating that he could not imagine a world without Cornell in it.</p>

Bennington's death occurred on what would have been Chris Cornell's 53rd birthday. Cornell's death was also ruled as suicide by hanging two months earlier. After Bennington's death, Linkin Park canceled the rest of their One More Light Tour and refunded tickets. His funeral was held on July 29 at South Coast Botanic Garden in Palos Verdes, California. In addition to his family members and close friends, many musicians who toured or played with Linkin Park also attended. The service also included a full stage for musical tributes.</p>

                    <p>Linkin Park hosted a public tribute for Bennington in LA on October 27, 2017, titled Linkin Park and Friends: Celebrate Life in Honor of Chester Bennington. The event featured the band’s first performance following his death, along with performances from Blink-182, members of System of a Down, Korn, Avenged Sevenfold, Bring Me the Horizon, Yellowcard, and many others. <br> <br> Chester Bennington is seen by many as one of the best vocalists of the 2000s. BBC’s Steve Holden called Bennington the “voice of a generation”, saying his voice was arguably Linkin Park’s greatest asset. Other musicians have also come out attributing Bennington as a huge inspiration for their own music. In an interview with Kerrang!, Oli Sykes, frontman to Bring Me The Horizon, said: </p>
                    <blockquote>“Chester’s voice was a huge inspiration… He 
                        was someone I looked up to… He was such an 
                        iconic and unique singer. I don’t think anyone 
                        sounded like him before, and I don’t think 
                        anyone will ever again. That mix of melody, 
                        catchiness and aggression is something I 
                        wanted to aim for myself.”
